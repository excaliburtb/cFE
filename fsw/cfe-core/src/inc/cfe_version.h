/*
 *  File: cfe_version.h
 *
 *  Purpose:
 *     Provide version identifiers for the cFE core.
 */

/*
 * \page cfeversion Version Numbers
 *
 * <H2> Version Number Semantics </H2>
 *
 * The version number is a sequence of four numbers, generally separated by dots when written. These are, in order,
 * the Major number, the Minor number, the Revision number, and the Mission Revision number. At
 * their option, Missions may modify the Mission Revision information as needed to suit their needs.
 *
 * It is important to note that Major, Minor, and Revision numbers are only updated upon official releases of tagged
 * versions, \b NOT on development builds.
 *
 * The MAJOR number shall be incremented on release to indicate when there is a change to an API
 * that may cause existing, correctly-written cFS components to stop working. It may also be incremented for a
 * release that contains changes deemed to be of similar impact, even if there are no actual changes to the API.
 *
 * The MINOR number shall be incremented on release to indicate the addition of features to the API
 * which do not break the existing code.  It may also be incremented for a release that contains changes deemed
 * to be of similar impact, even if there are no actual updates to the API.
 *
 * The REVISION number shall be incremented on changes that benefit from unique identification such as bug fixes or
 * major documentation updates. The Revision number may also be updated if there are other changes contained within a
 * release that make it desirable for applications to distinguish one release from another.
 *
 * The Major, Minor, and Revision numbers are provided in this header file as part of the API
 * definition; this macro must expand to a simple integer value, so that it can be used in simple if directives
 * by the macro preprocessor.
 *
 * The Mission Version number shall be set to zero in all officially released packages, and is entirely reserved
 * for the use of the mission. The Mission Version is provided as a simple macro defined in the cfe_platform_cfg.h
 * header file.
 *
 * <H2> Version Number Flexibility </H2>
 *
 * The major number may increment when there is no breaking change to the API, if the changes are significant enough to
 * warrant the same level of attention as a breaking API change.
 *
 * The minor number may increment when there have been no augmentations to the API, if changes are as significant as
 * additions to the public API.
 *
 * The revision numbers may increment in implementations where no actual implementation-specific code has changed, if
 * there are other changes within the release with similar significance.
 *
 * <H2> How and Where Defined </H2>
 *
 * The Major, Minor, and Revision components of the version are provided as simple macros defined in the cfe_version.h
 * header file as part of the API definition; these macros must expand to simple integer values, so that they can be
 * used in simple if directives by the macro preprocessor.
 *
 * The Mission Version is provided as a simple macro defined in the cfe_platform_cfg.h header file. As delivered in
 * official releases, these macros must expand to simple integer values, so that they can be used in simple macro
 * preprocessor conditions, but delivered code should not prevent a mission from, for example, deciding that the Mission
 * Version is actually a text string.
 *
 * <H2> Identification of development builds </H2>
 *
 * In order to distinguish between development versions, we also provide a BUILDNUMBER.
 *
 * The BUILD_NUMBER reflects the number of commits since a specified baseline git tag for each particular component. The
 * BUILD_NUMBER integer increases monotonically for a given development cycle. The development cycle can be identified by
 * the git tag baseline in the CFE_VERSION macro, which looks like vX.Y.Z+dev, or by the codename in the version string.
 * When a new baseline tag and codename are created, the the BUILDNUMBER resets to zero and begins increasing from that
 * new epoch.
